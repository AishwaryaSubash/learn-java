ACM
    Association of Computing Machinery, Student Chapter
        SVCE ACM Student Chapter was set up by students of CSE department under the guidance of ACM Student Chapter faculty coordinator. It was officially chartered by ACM New York on 26th August 2011. ACM is an international organization whose aim is "Advancing computing as a science and profession". A team of 26 enthusiastic students from the Department took the initiative to set up this chapter. The official launch was on 22nd September 2011. SVCE ACM student chapter was set up to facilitate all activities which aim at spreading quality computing education by setting up learning groups, organizing seminars, conducting workshops, facilitating contests and so on.

    ACM-SVCE STUDENTS CHAPTER
        The SVCE ACM student chapter aims to provide an opportunity for students from different walks of life to compete and tackle problems in an effective manner. As one of the well-known institutions inside the college, we aim to bolster student skills from both a professional and personal point of view by organising events like Hackathons, workshops and quizzes. As we set foot into our seventh successful year, we aim to maintain the high standards set by our predecessors by organising events intertwined with fun and frolic, for we believe in: "Simplicity, carried to the extreme, becomes elegance".
        Organizing technical events intertwined with loads of fun filled challenges is our forte. Our wide variety of events boosts both 'competing by learning' as well as 'learning by competing'! Participating in our events helps you take a step towards success, and thereby guides you to make your path towards success an interesting one rather than a difficult one.

Office of the Principal
    Prof.Dr.S Ganesh Vaidyanathan Ph.D    

Welcome Note
    Greetings!
    Welcome to SVCE!
    I thank you for your interest in SVCE. Since its inception in 1985, Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering has taken long strides and grown in stature and reputation in the province of engineering education. The College is in its 30th year. In these thirty years of the journey it has progressed a lot. It has gained the reputation of offering exceptional engineering education as proven by the scholarly accomplishment of its students. It has also made certain remarkable contributions to engineering education. A most significant accomplishment is conceiving and designing the syllabus for B.Tech – IT and B.E Marine and gaining the approval of University of Madras. Right through its history SVCE has enjoyed the patronage of parents and students and has had the first year seats filled up in the first two days of counseling. This, we believe, is because of the reputation the Institute has earned in the Industry in India and abroad primarily due to the exceptional performance of our alumni. All of our eligible students get placed in firms of repute. And several of them get dual offers, as well. Those who prefer to pursue higher studies get into great global universities.
    We are proud of our faculty and staff. They ensure that each and every student’s learning experience is rewarding and gratifying by complementing theoretical knowledge with practical training. This experience also kindles the curiosity of students and inspires them to involve themselves in our ongoing research projects and explore new fields as well. Research, thus, is an essential element of the educational experience at SVCE.
    Learning, at SVCE, has never been limited to the classroom, learners are exposed to a variety of activities – curricular and extra-curricular – that help them to hone their skills and develop rounded personality, receive a career-focused education and earn a name for themselves and for their alma mater.
    I should also say that we do not rest on our laurels. We always strive to make learning experiences more pleasant and challenging. I welcome you to the fraternity of SVCE to realize your aspirations and reach your academic and career goals in the quickest possible time.

GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL CELL (GRC)
    The function of the cell is to look into the complaints lodged by any student, and judge its merit. The Grievance cell is also empowered to look into matters of harassment. Anyone with a genuine grievance may approach the department members in person, or in consultation with the Students Council. In case the person is unwilling to appear in self, grievances may be dropped in writing at the letterbox/suggestion box of the Grievance Cell at Administrative Block.

Objective:
    The objective of the Grievance Cell is to develop a responsive and accountable attitude among all the stakeholders in order to maintain a harmonious educational atmosphere in the institute. A Grievance Cell should be constituted for the Redressal of the problems reported by the Students of the College with the following objectives:
    Upholding the dignity of the College by ensuring strife free atmosphere in the College through promoting cordial Student-Student relationship and Student-Teacher relationship etc.
    Encouraging the Students to express their grievances / problems freely and frankly, without any fear of being victimized.
    Suggestion / complaint Box is installed in front of the Administrative Block in which the Students, who want to remain anonymous, put in writing their grievances and their suggestions for improving the Academics / Administration in the College. 
    Advising Students of the College to respect the right and dignity of one another and show utmost restraint and patience whenever any occasion of rift arises. 
    Advising all the Students to refrain from inciting Students against other Students, Teachers and College administration 
    Advising all staffs to be affectionate to the Students and not behave in a vindictive manner towards any of them for any reason. 
    Ragging in any form is strictly prohibited in and outside the institution. Any violation of ragging and disciplinary rules should be urgently brought to the notice of the Principal.

MECHANISM FOR REDRESSAL OF GRIEVANCES OF STUDENTS and STAFF
    The students are the main stakeholders in any institution imparting education, and it is our endeavour to make all efforts to ensure transparency in all the activities at different stages. Taking this spirit in consideration the institute has decided to provide mechanism to students for Redressal of their grievances as under:

    The Grievances may broadly include the following complaints of the aggrieved students

    Academic 
    Non-Academic
    Grievance related to Assessment 
    Grievance related to Victimization 
    Grievance related to Attendance 
    Grievance related to charging of fees 
    Grievance regarding conducting of Examinations 
    Harassment by colleague students or the teachers etc.
    It is good to air a grievance rather than to keep it bottled up. Protection of human rights is essential for all round development of an individual’s personality. To realize the primary needs of the students and staff and secure civil liberties for everybody, a Grievance Redressal Cell has been constituted. The cell is indented to find solutions for problems like, (i) Sexual harassment - any kind of physical or mental harassment (ii) Complaints regarding class room teaching - class room management, completion of syllabus, teaching methods, etc., if and when they arise. The Grievance Redressal Cell convenes meetings periodically and takes steps to redress the grievance.
